### 5-Step Systematic Process

* Define the Problem
* Prepare Data
* Spot Check Algorithms
* Improve Results
* Present Results
<br><br><br><br><br>

#### 1. Define the Problem

#### 2. Prepare Data

Step 1: Data Selection  
Step 2: Data Preprocessing  
Step 3: Data Transformation  

#### 3. Spot Check Algorithms  

#### 4. Improve Results

Algorithm Tuning: where discovering the best models is treated like a search problem through model parameter space.  
Ensemble Methods: where the predictions made by multiple models are combined.  
Extreme Feature Engineering: where the attribute decomposition and aggregation seen in data preparation is pushed to the limits.
